<h2 id="Introduction"> :pencil: Introduction </h2>

<p align="justify">
Welcome to the Flight Booking Management System! This project was developed as part of my DBMS course, combining my knowledge of Python-SQL connectivity and the PyQt5 GUI library to create a user-friendly and visually appealing application. The system allows users to create accounts, log in, and confirm their identity through OTP verification (with occasional help from Twilio, if it's in the mood!). Once logged in, users can easily access and view flight details, including arrival and departure times and locations, presented in a well-organized table format. While the payment and cancellation functionalities are currently in prototype stage, they demonstrate the system's potential for future expansion. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in working with MySQL and improving my understanding of Python-SQL connectivity, enhancing my skills in database management and application development.

<h2 id="Learning from the Project"> :cloud: Learning from the Project</h2>
<p align="justify">

Through the development of the Flight Booking Management System, several key learning points were obtained:

- Understanding the Ticket Management/Booking system and its overall process.
- Gaining insight into the integration of front-end (GUI) and back-end (Database) components.
- Efficient retrieval and modification of data based on user preferences.
- Clearer understanding of database management systems, including concepts such as normalization, weak entities, SQL commands, relationship cardinalities, and attribute constraints.
- Exposure to new errors and problems not encountered in weekly labs, leading to enhanced problem-solving skills and a better grasp of MySQL.
- Learning the PyQt5 + Qt Designer interface, enabling the creation of seamless UI screens (screenshots of respective screens shown above).
- Integration of front-end with back-end, extracting user data through GUI elements (text boxes, interactive buttons), and merging them into the respective database relations.

These aspects of the project have contributed to an expanded knowledge base and improved skills in building user-friendly interfaces and effectively managing data within a database system.

<h2 id="Challenges Faced"> :cloud: Challenges Faced</h2>
<p align="justify">
  
During the development of the Flight Booking Management System, the following challenges were encountered:

- Integrating the front end with the back end proved to be a complex task, requiring meticulous attention to detail.
- OTP verification occasionally failed, requiring thorough debugging and refinement of the implementation.
- Data loss and modification issues arose during the merging process to the back end, necessitating rigorous testing and validation procedures.
- Connectivity issues with the MySQL Connector library posed obstacles, requiring extensive research and troubleshooting.
- Some relations within the database fetched incorrect tuples, demanding careful examination and rectification.
- Adding certain values resulted in unexpected program crashes due to primary key errors.
- Ensuring the normalization of tables proved challenging and required meticulous design and restructuring of the database schema.
- Certain buttons in the graphical user interface did not function as intended, and labels were not displayed correctly on their respective screens.
- Importing the appropriate libraries for the project required attention to detail and resolution of any library-related issues.

Overcoming these challenges contributed to the development of a more robust and functional Flight Booking Management System.
